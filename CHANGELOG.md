# Change Log

## WIP
## Added
- `EnCla` index, a novel index for Datalog store. Also address #57.
- `Links` index, a novel index for Datalog store.
- Cost based Datalog query optimizer that utilizes EnCla and Links indices. #11
- Benchmark suits for complex queries and large data sets
- Expose LMDB dupsort functionality (the same key maps to a list of sorted
  values) as list functions: `open-list-dbi`, `in-list?`, `put-list-items`, etc.
- Add pull API to client/server and babashka pods
## Changed
- [**Breaking**] Change `EAV` and `AVE` index storage to use LMDB dupsort,
  reducing storage size and improving speed.
- [**Breaking**] Removed `VEA` index, its functionality is replaced by `Links`.

## 0.6.20
### Added
- [Pod] `entity` and `touch` function to babashka pod. These return regular
  maps, as the `Entity` type does not exist in a babashka script. #148 (thx
  @ngrunwald)

## 0.6.19
### Changed
- [Datalog] Entity equality requires DB identity in order to better support
  reactive applications, #146 (thx @den1k)
### Improved
- bump deps

## 0.6.18
### Fixed
- [Search] corner case of search in document collection containing only one term, #143
- [Datalog] entity IDs has smaller than expected range, now they cover full 32 bit integer range, #140
### Added
- [Datalog] Persistent `max-tx`, #142

## 0.6.17
### Added
- [Datalog] `tx-data->simulated-report` to obtain a transaction report without
  actually persisting the changes. (thx @TheExGenesis)
- [KV] Support `:bigint` and `:bigdec` data types, corresponding to
  `java.math.BigInteger` and `java.math.BigDecimal`, respectively.
- [Datalog] Support `:db.type/bigdec` and `:db.type/bigint`, correspondingly, #138.
### Improved
 - Better documentation so that cljdoc can build successfully. (thx @lread)

## 0.6.16
### Added
- [Datalog] Additional arity to `update-schema` to allow renaming attributes. #131
- [Search] `clear-docs` function to wipe out search index, as it might be faster
  to rebuild search index than updating individual documents sometimes. #132
- `datalevin.constants/*data-serializable-classes*` dynamic var, which can be
  used for `binding` if additional Java classes are to be serialized as part of
  the default `:data` data type. #134
### Improved
- [Datalog] Allow passing option map as `:kv-opts` to underlying KV store when `create-conn`
- bump deps
### Fixed
- [Datalog] `clear` function on server. #133
### Changed
- [Datalog] Changed `:search-engine` option map key to `:search-opts` for consistency [**Breaking**]

### Improved
- [Search] Handle empty documents
- [Datalog] Handle safe schema migration, #1, #128
- bump deps

## 0.6.14
### Fixed
- Fixed adding created-at schema item for upgrading Datalog DB from prior 0.6.4 (thx @jdf-id-au)
### Changed
- [**breaking**] Simplified `open-dbi` signature to take an option map instead
### Added
- `:validate-data?` option for `open-dbi`, `create-conn` etc., #121

## 0.6.13
### Fixed
- Schema update regression. #124
### Added
- `:domain` option to `new-search-engine`, so multiple search engines can
  coexist in the same `dir`, each with its own domain, a string. #112

## 0.6.12
### Fixed
- Server failure to update max-eid regression, #123
### Added
- Added an arity to `update-schema` to allow removal of attributes if they are
  not associated with any datoms, #99

### Fixed
- Search add-doc error when alter existing docs

## 0.6.10
### Improved
- Persistent server session that survives restarts without affecting clients, #119
- More robust server error handling

- Handle concurrent `add-doc` for the same doc ref
## Improved
- Bump deps

## 0.6.7
## Fixed

### Fixed
- Dot form Java interop regression in query, #103
### Added

  `:db/created-at` and `:db/updated-at` values added and maintained
  automatically by the system during transaction, #86
### Improved
- Dependency bump

## 0.6.3
### Added
- `doc-count` function returns the number of documents in the search index
- `doc-refs` function returns a seq of `doc-ref` in the search index

- Key-value database `visit` function to do arbitrary things upon seeing a
  value in a range

### Fixed
- [**breaking**]`:instant` handles dates before 1970 correctly, #94. The storage
  format of `:instant` type has been changed. For existing Datalog DB containing
  `:db.type/instant`, dumping as a Datalog DB using the old version of dtlv, then
  loading the data is required; For existing key-value DB containing `:instant`
  type, specify `:instant-pre-06` instead to read the data back in, then write
  them out as `:instant` to upgrade to the current format.

### Improved

  lightweight transaction pool
- Dependency bump

## 0.5.31

- Occasional server message write corruptions in busy network traffic on Linux.

## 0.5.17
### Added

### Changed
- Talk to Babashka pods client in transit+json

## 0.4.27
### Added
- Exposed more functions to Babashka pod

## 0.4.26
### Added

## 0.4.13
### Fixed
- Handle list form in query properly in command line shell [#42]

## 0.4.4
### Changed
- Consolidated all user facing functions to `datalevin.core`, so users don't have to understand and require different namespaces in order to use all features.

## 0.4.0
### Changed
- [**Breaking**] Removed AEV index, as it is not used in query. This reduces storage
  and improves write speed.
- [**Breaking**] Change VAE index to VEA, in preparation for new query engine. Now
  all indices have the same order, just rotated, so merge join is more likely.
- [**Breaking**] Change `open-lmdb` and `close-lmdb` to `open-kv` and `close-kv`,
  `lmdb/transact` to `lmdb/transact-kv`, so they are consistent, easier to
  remember, and distinct from functions in `datalevin.core`.

### Added
- GraalVM native image specific LMDB wrapper. This wrapper allocates buffer
  memory in C and uses our own C comparator instead of doing these work in Java,
  so it is faster.
- Native command line shell, `dtlv`

## 0.3.17
### Changed
- Improve Java interop call performance

## 0.3.16

## 0.3.15
### Changed
- Changed default LMDB write behavior to use writable memory map and
  asynchronous msync, significantly improved write speed for small transactions
  (240X improvement for writing one datom at a time).

## 0.3.14
### Fixed
- Read `:db.type/instant` value as `java.util.Date`, not as `long` [#30]

## 0.3.13

### Changed
- Expose all data types to key-value store API [#24]

## 0.3.2
### Changed
- Add value type for `:db/ident` in implicit schema

## 0.3.1
### Changed
- [**Breaking**] Change argument order of `core/create-conn`, `db/empty-db`
  etc., and put `dir` in front, since it is more likely to be specified than
  `schema` in real use, so users don't have to put `nil` for `schema`.

## 0.2.19
### Fixed
- correct `core/update-schema`

## 0.2.18

### Fixed
- correctly handle `false` value as `:data`
- always clear buffer before putting data in

- use array get wherenever we can in query, saw significant improvement in some queries.
- use `db/-first` instead of `(first (db/-datom ..))`, `db/-populated?` instead of `(not-empty (db/-datoms ..)`, as they do not realize the results hence faster.
